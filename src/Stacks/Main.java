/**
 * This class provides an overview and documentation for the Stack data structure.
 * <p>
 * A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
 * This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.
 * <p>
 * Key Operations:
 * - push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
 * - pop: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
 * - peek: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
 * - isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
 * - size: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
 * <p>
 * Abstract Data Type (ADT):
 * - A stack can be defined as an abstract data type with the above operations.
 * - It can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or other data structures.
 * <p>
 * Exceptions:
 * - StackOverflowException: Thrown when trying to push an element onto a full stack (in array-based implementations).
 * - EmptyStackException: Thrown when trying to pop or peek from an empty stack.
 * <p>
 * Applications:
 * - Function call management in programming languages (call stack).
 * - Expression evaluation and syntax parsing (e.g., converting infix to postfix expressions).
 * - Undo mechanisms in text editors.
 * - Depth-first search (DFS) in graph algorithms.
 * - Balancing symbols (e.g., parentheses in expressions).
 * <p>
 * Implementation:
 * - Array-based implementation: Uses a fixed-size array to store elements. Efficient but has a fixed capacity.
 * - Linked list-based implementation: Uses nodes to store elements. Dynamic size but requires more memory per element.
 * <p>
 * Comparison of Implementations:
 * - Array-based: Faster access time (O(1) for push and pop), but limited by fixed size.
 * - Linked list-based: Dynamic size, but slightly slower access time due to pointer dereferencing.
